# Project
I created this project to centralize my benchmark tests.

# Benchmarks
1. [AutoMapper benchmark](./automapperbenchmark.md)
2. [Find One Benchmark](./findonebenchmark.md)
3. [Numeric Operation Benchmark](./numericbenchmark.md)

# Timing reference
Just as a refresher:
Here is a reference chart for common time units in the context of computer science and engineering:

| Unit        | Abbreviation | Conversion Factor       |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Millisecond | ms           | 1 ms = 0.001 s          |
| Microsecond | µs           | 1 µs = 0.000001 s       |
| Nanosecond  | ns           | 1 ns = 0.000000001 s    |
| Picosecond  | ps           | 1 ps = 0.000000000001 s |

- 1 Second (s) is the basic unit of time in the International System of Units (SI).
- 1 Millisecond (ms) is equal to 1/1000th of a second.
- 1 Microsecond (µs) is equal to 1/1000000th of a second.
- 1 Nanosecond (ns) is equal to 1/1000000000th of a second.
- 1 Picosecond (ps) is equal to 1/1000000000000th of a second.

It is important to notice that these units are used in different context. Milliseconds and seconds are common in context of human perception and everyday life. Microseconds, nanoseconds and picoseconds are commonly used in context of computer systems and physics.
