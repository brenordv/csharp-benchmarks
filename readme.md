# Project
I created this project to centralize my benchmark tests.

# Benchmarks
1. [AutoMapper benchmark](./automapperbenchmark.md)
2. [Find One Benchmark](./findonebenchmark.md)

# Timing reference
Just as a refresher:
There are 1,000 nanoseconds (ns) in 1 microsecond (Î¼s).
There are 1,000 microseconds in 1 millisecond (ms).
Therefore, there are 1,000 x 1,000 = 1,000,000 nanoseconds in 1 millisecond.
To convert from nanoseconds to milliseconds, divide the number of nanoseconds by 1,000,000.

So, 10,000 nanoseconds is equal to 10,000 / 1,000,000 = 0.01 milliseconds.
